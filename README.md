# Rainfall Prediction

## About
Rainfall Prediction is the application to predict the amount of rainfall over a region. It is important to exactly determine the rainfall for effective use of water resources, crop productivity and pre-planning of water structures.

Linear Regression is used to predict the amount of rainfall. We used Austin, Texas public weather dataset which is available on Kaggle. It can be downloaded from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/grubenm/austin-weather)
